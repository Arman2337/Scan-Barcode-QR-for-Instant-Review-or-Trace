## 📘 Project Story: Scan Barcode/QR on Product for Instant Review & Traceability

---

## 💡 Inspiration

The idea came from a common real-world problem:

- **Consumers** often don’t trust whether a product is original or fake.
- **Sellers and manufacturers** rarely get instant, meaningful feedback on their products.

I wanted to build something that could **bridge the gap between physical products and digital feedback**. By simply **scanning a barcode or QR code**, users could instantly trace the product and give feedback. That was the spark behind this project.

## 🚀 What it does

- 📷 Scans QR codes or barcodes using a device camera.
- 🔍 Instantly retrieves product details from **MongoDB**.
- 🌐 If not found in the database, fetches data from an **external API**, then stores it for future use.
- 📄 Displays the scanned product’s name, image, and other metadata.
- 🛠 Admin dashboard automatically updates with scanned product entries.
- 💬 (Coming soon) Users will be able to **submit reviews and feedback** directly after scanning.

## 🛠️ How we built it

### 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: `React.js`, `Tailwind CSS`
- **Backend**: `Express.js`, `Node.js`
- **Database**: `MongoDB` with `Mongoose`
- **QR/Barcode Scanning**: [`zxing`](https://github.com/zxing-js/library) library
- **External API**: Used for product details if not found in our DB
- **Hosting**: `Vercel` for frontend, `Vercel` for backend

### 💡 Architecture Overview

User scans QR/barcode with zxing scanner

Code sent to backend via API call

Backend checks MongoDB:

If found → send product info to frontend

If not → call external API → save product to DB → return data

Admin panel auto-displays new product entries

yaml
Always show details

## 🧩 Challenges we ran into

- 📸 Handling camera permission issues across devices
- 🧠 Barcode decoding errors and scanner sensitivity
- 🌐 Managing external API limits and failed responses
- 🔄 Avoiding duplicate entries in MongoDB
- 🎨 Making the scanner and product detail page responsive and user-friendly

---


## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- ✅ Fully functional **scan-to-database** product system
- 🔄 Automatic database update when a scanned product is new
- 🧑‍💼 Admin dashboard that reflects product info in real-time
- 📱 Smooth and responsive experience on both desktop and mobile
- 🔍 Reliable scanning performance using the `zxing` library

## 📚 What we learned

- How to integrate **real-time scanning** in a web app using the `zxing` library
- Backend data handling with **Express.js and MongoDB**
- Managing fallback logic when product data is missing
- Real-world UI/UX patterns for **scanning interfaces**
- Clean API design and frontend-backend communication
